# Free Sample Libraries (SFZ)
All of my free sample libraries with SFZ files configured for any SFZ-based sampler.

## The Libraries
### Baritone Stratocaster
The Stratocaster in question is my MIM Fender Blacktop Stratocaster. I have swapped out the neck for a Warmoth Baritone Conversion Neck (28 5/8" scale). I have replaced the pickups with a Dimarzio D Activator in the bridge and added a coil split. It was recorded directly into my Focusrite Scarlett Solo 2nd Gen. This library is specifically for high-gain, metal tones. There are clicks and pops that can be hidden by most high-gain setups.

I have recorded two libraries with the Baritone Stratocaster: Humbucker and Split Coil. As the name suggests, the humbucker library is recorded with the full humbucker. The split coil library is recorded with the north coil of the humbucker.

#### Velocity Map
0 - 32: Medium Velocity Palm Mutes  
33 - 63: High Velocity Palm Mutes  
64 - 96: Medium Velocity Open Notes  
97 - 127: High Velocity Open Notes  

### Shecter Bass
The bass in question is my Schecter Diamond Series Elite-5. I have made no modifications. The pickups are the default EMG HZ pickups. It was recorded directly into my Focusrite Scarlett Solo 2nd Gen. This library is specifically for high-gain, metal tones. There are clicks and pops when used otherwise.

I have recorded one library with this bass.

#### Velocity Map
0 - 63: Medium Velocity Open Notes  
64 - 127: High Velocity Open Notes

## What is SFZ?
SFZ is a file format for sampled instruments. It is a markup language, a computer language that uses tags and keycodes to define elements of a document. Do you need to know anything about how it works in order to use it? Absolutely not, but if you want to make sample libraries and instruments you should definitely check it out.

## How To Install

1. Click on [this link](https://github.com/lotkey/free-sample-libraries-sfz/archive/main.zip) to download all the samples and the SFZ files.  
2. Extract the files onto a folder in your computer. Let's call that folder "Folder" for now.
3. Download and install an SFZ-based sampler. I use sforzando which can be downloaded for free from [their website](https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html) for Windows (VST) or macOS (AU).
4. Load one of the SFZ files from this repository. The SFZ files will be in Folder/free-sample-libraries-sfz-main/. They will have the ".sfz" file extension.
5. That's it! Make some sick riffs. If you come up with something cool shoot me an email at synthchrismusic@gmail.com.
