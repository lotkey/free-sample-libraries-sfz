# Free Sample Libraries (SFZ)
All of my free sample libraries with SFZ files configured for any SFZ-based sampler.

## The Libraries


## What is SFZ?

## How To Install

1. Click on [this link](https://github.com/lotkey/free-sample-libraries-sfz/archive/main.zip) to download all the samples and the SFZ files.  
2. Extract the files onto a folder in your computer. Let's call that folder "Folder" for now.
3. Download and install an SFZ-based sampler. I use sforzando which can be downloaded for free from [their website](https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html).
4. Load one of the SFZ files from this repository. The SFZ files will be in Folder/free-sample-libraries-sfz-main/. They will have the ".sfz" file extension.
5. That's it! Make some sick riffs.
